  <p>Waikiki, with its beautiful stretch of oceanfront beach, is Hawaii's biggest tourist attraction. 
    The name Waikiki, in essence, means “spouting waters,” and refers to the freshwater rivers that once flowed towards the ocean. 
    Located on the south shore of Honolulu, the world-famous neighborhood of Waikiki was once a playground for Hawaiian royalty. 
    Waikiki is most famous for its beaches and every room is just two or three blocks away from the sea. But there’s more to 
    Waikiki than just the beach. Attractions of Waikiki like the Honolulu Zoo and the Waikiki Aquarium offer fun for the whole family.
    With many attractions, shopping, dining, entertainment, activities and resorts, Waikiki continues to be an evolving expression of 
    the ancient spirit of aloha.</p>
